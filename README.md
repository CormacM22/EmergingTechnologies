# EmergingTechnologies

This repository contains a Trigrams Notebook and an ELIZA Chatbot.

## Trigrams

The Trigrams Notebook demonstrates a third-order letter approximation model based on trigrams. It analyzes English texts sourced from Project Gutenberg. Trigrams are sequences of three consecutive characters and are used to predict text by modeling character relationships.

## Steps to Run:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code (or your preferred IDE).
3. Open trigrams.ipynb.
4. Click the button, "run all", to run trigrams.ipynb.

## Features
- Builds a trigram model for character-level prediction.
- Processes English text to generate probabilistic character sequences.
